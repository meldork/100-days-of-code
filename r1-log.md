### R1D1
Completed the intro and first level to CodeAcademy's Javascript course... Feeling good. Can't decide if I am able to focus completely on it because it's late at night, or if coding is just that interesting to me. It's just solving infinite problems, I love it. To do tomorrow - Check out ZIM maybe? Brush up on some HTML/CSS script... Find ways to make my life easier.
