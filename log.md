# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Finished intro to Javascript on CodeAcademy

**Thoughts:** Completed the intro and first level to CodeAcademy's Javascript course... Feeling good. Can't decide if I am able to focus completely on it because it's late at night, or if coding is just that interesting to me. It's just solving infinite problems, I love it. To do tomorrow - Check out ZIM maybe? Brush up on some HTML/CSS script... Find ways to make my life easier.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Refreshers to h, p, class, IDs, font styling, google fonts.

**Thoughts**: Did 20 challenges of for freecodecamp, and feeling great about the refreshers that comes with it. I wish I had done it earlier in the day, so I have a plan to code earlier in the day instead of really late at night. I'm going to hate myself tomorrow morning, but that's okay, just means that I'll have to do it earlier. I knew all of the CSS and HTML introductions that freecodecamp was introducing to me, so a soft start is nice. Tomorrow, I'm doing at least 30 challenges.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
